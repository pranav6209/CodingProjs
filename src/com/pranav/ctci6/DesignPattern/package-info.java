*	1.	Creational
	
	How efficiently you can create an object
	
	2.	Behavioral 
	
	Interactions between object. How one object will behave with other

	3.Structural 
	
	How the object are compose. Is there inheritance (IS-A relationship,HAS-A relationship)
	
	
	
	
	1.1 Singleton
	
		
		Only have one instance of a particular class.
		Java.lang.system ---> only runs on one systemâ€¦
		When programs runs on multiple jvm, it has a one instance per jvm
	
		Private Constructor
		Enum--
		JEE7 annotation @singleton will make class singleton..
		Should be avoided as much as possible, because hard to unit test.
		In Spring all the beans are singleton...

	1.2	Factory
	
		In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to client and the client use 
		the same common interface to create new type of object.
